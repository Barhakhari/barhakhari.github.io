# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 1 Jan 2025

At Barhakhari, we value the privacy and safety of all users, including children and adults. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect data associated with the app, in compliance with regulations such as **COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act)** and **GDPR-K (General Data Protection Regulation for Kids)**. 

We assure you that Barhakhari takes your privacy seriously and strives to create a safe, educational environment for all.

---

### Data Collection

**Barhakhari** is designed to limit data collection while maintaining app functionality. Below is a summary of what we collect and why:

- **No Personal Data**: We do not collect any personal data such as name, address, email, or phone number.
- **Technical Information for Feedback**: If you provide feedback, the following technical details may be included to help resolve issues:
  - App version
  - Device name
  - iOS version

This data is anonymized and not linked to any individual user.

---

### Parental Consent

Barhakhari does not collect or request personal information directly from children. Children can safely use the app under parental or guardian supervision.

---

### Expanded Audience

Barhakhari is an educational tool designed for both **children and adults**. While children can learn Nepali alphabets and rhymes, adults can also use the app to learn the Nepali language effectively.

---

### Usage of the App

To operate effectively:
- An **internet connection** is required to download resources and display ads.
- **Anonymous usage data** may be collected for improving app functionality. This data cannot identify or track individual users.

---

### Advertising in the App

Barhakhari displays **contextual ads** through **Google AdMob**, ensuring compliance with child privacy regulations such as COPPA and GDPR-K. 

- **Non-Personalized Ads**: Ads shown in the app are based on content context, not user behavior.
- **Age-Appropriate Ads**: All ad creatives are reviewed manually by human moderators to ensure they are safe and appropriate for children.
- **Safe Navigation**: Tapping on an ad may redirect the user to external content (e.g., the App Store or a website). However, all ads are carefully vetted for safety and relevance to children.

For more details on Google AdMob’s policies, please visit their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
