# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 1 Jan 2025

At Barhakhari, we value the privacy and safety of all users, including children and adults. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect data associated with the app, in compliance with regulations such as **COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act)** and **GDPR-K (General Data Protection Regulation for Kids)**. 

We assure you that Barhakhari takes your privacy seriously and strives to create a safe, educational environment for all.

---

### Data Collection

**Barhakhari** is designed to limit data collection while maintaining app functionality. Below is a summary of what we collect and why:

- **No Personal Data**: We do not collect any personal data such as name, address, email, or phone number.
- **Technical Information for Feedback**: If you provide feedback, the following technical details may be included to help resolve issues:
  - App version
  - Device name
  - iOS version

This data is anonymized and not linked to any individual user.

---

### Year Picker and Age Verification

When the app is used for the first time, users are required to select their birth year using a **Year Picker**. This process ensures compliance with child-specific privacy regulations. 

- If the user is **under 13 years old**, ads will **not** be displayed in the app to comply with privacy laws and provide a safer experience.
- If the user is **13 years or older**, non-personalized ads may be displayed in the app through **Google AdMob**.

The selected birth year is stored locally on the device using **UserDefaults** and is not shared with any third party.

---

### Parental Consent

Barhakhari does not collect or request personal information directly from children. If you are under 13 years old, please use the app only under parental or guardian supervision. 

For users under 13, parental consent is required for any data-sharing activity beyond what is outlined here.

---

### Expanded Audience

Barhakhari is an educational tool designed for both **children and adults**. While children can learn Nepali alphabets and rhymes, adults can also use the app to learn the Nepali language effectively.

---

### Usage of the App

To operate effectively:
- An **internet connection** is required to download resources and display ads (only for users 13 years or older).
- **Anonymous usage data** may be collected for improving app functionality. This data cannot identify or track individual users.

---

### Advertisements

Barhakhari displays ads through **Google AdMob**, with specific rules based on the user's age:
- **For users under 13 years old**: Ads will **not** be displayed in the app to ensure compliance with child-specific privacy regulations such as COPPA and GDPR-K.
- **For users 13 years or older**: Ads displayed in the app are **non-personalized** and compliant with privacy laws.

We encourage parents to review the privacy policy of Google AdMob for more details:
