# Privacy Policy


Effective Date: 14 Nov 2024


At Barhakhari, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect data associated with the app. We want to assure you that Barhakhari takes your privacy seriously.

### Data Collection

**Barhakhari** does not collect any personal data from users. We do not collect any identifying information, such as your name, address, email, or phone number.

### Usage of the App

The app is designed to guide children in writing Nepali alphabets, one letter at a time. While using the app, an internet connection is required to download resources and display ads. The app does not store any personal information, but it may collect anonymized usage data to enhance the user experience, which is not tied to any specific individual.

### Advertisements

Barhakhari uses third-party advertising services to display ads while you are using the app. These ads may collect information about your device and usage of the app for advertising purposes. However, no personal information such as your name, address, or email is collected or shared.

We do not control the content or the data collection practices of these third-party ad services. Please refer to the privacy policies of the third-party advertisers for more information on how they collect and use data.

### No Third-Party Services for Data Collection

Apart from the ad services mentioned above, we do not use any other third-party services, such as analytics or social media integration, that track your personal information or usage.

However, our app includes the ability to play YouTube videos, specifically children’s rhymes, using the default YouTube player. These videos are streamed directly from YouTube and comply with YouTube’s API Terms of Service. When you play a video, YouTube may collect certain information as part of its normal operation, such as device data and usage patterns, in accordance with YouTube’s Privacy Policy.

We do not collect, store, or process any personal data related to your use of YouTube videos within the app.

### Security

Since Barhakhari does not collect or store personal information, there is no data to secure. However, we take reasonable measures to ensure the app functions securely and as intended. If we make any changes to the way we handle data in the future, we will update this privacy policy and notify users in advance.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update or modify this privacy policy at any time. If we make any changes, the updated privacy policy will be posted in the app and on our website. By continuing to use the app after any changes to this privacy policy, you agree to the updated terms.
